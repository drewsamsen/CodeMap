CodeMap

This is a Rails application to help me record notes about what I am learning in various areas - JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, etc.

My Own Personal Doc Archive
===========================

As I am reading, researching, or working a project, I find that I am often taking notes about the things I'm learning.  Many of these notes are things like "this seems important - come back to this later and research it in more depth".

This application allows me to quickly record notes about what I'm learning that include:

- A summary of the concept, technology, gem, plugin, method, class, etc
- Reference locations for learning more
- Code samples
- My current level of understanding of a concept
- My perceived importance level of a concept
- And more

The result is a sort of personal documentation archive. 

A Learning Tool
===============

Not only is CodeMape good for building my own personalized doc archive, but it is also a valuable learning tool.

CodeMap is also a tool for keeping track of areas I need to improve. 

**For example**, a note about lexical scoping might have an importance level of 4/5 but only an understanding level of 2/5. So, it's important... but I don't have a good grip on it yet.

Details like that can be used to dynamically find the notes which most need my attention. 

Then, after learning more about lexical scoping and recording some code samples, I might adjust my understanding level to 4/5. Much better.

Progress: The Big Picture
=========================

I also plan to expand the app to include a way of calculating my total learning progress in each language/framework. How cool would it be to see a chart of your progress through Ruby over time? Very cool.
